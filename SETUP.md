No additional dependencies should be required.

Sometimes module functions will be loaded that are useful to the problem case.
You'll see them in the `define-package` macro at the top of the source file,
thus: `#:autoload (mod submod) (function0 function1)`. The curious can read
about included modules [here][0].

If you need help getting set up, see [Getting Started With Scheme][1]
in the [Exercism.io Help][2] pages.
