Scheme is a tail-recursive and statically scoped dialect of the Lisp programming language.
It was built to have uncomplicated semantics and several different ways to form
expressions. Multiple programming paradigms, including functional, message,
and imperative, find easy expression in Scheme. 

Scheme was invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman.
