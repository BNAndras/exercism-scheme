# xScheme

Exercism exercises in the Scheme Programming Language

## Setup

You'll need a vaguely [R6RS](http://www.r6rs.org/)-compliant Scheme implementation. As of this writing, the exercises are being developed primarily in [Guile Scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/), but the tests are using [SFRI-64](http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-64/srfi-64.html), and so should (hopefully) be rather implementation-agnostic.

## Working on Problems

Each problem should have a test suite and an example solution, as well as a stub file for the solution declaring the module and exports. The example solution should be named `example.scm`.
